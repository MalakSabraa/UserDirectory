# Mini User Directory

A simple React + TypeScript app that fetches a list of users from an external API and displays them with styling from Tailwind CSS.
Features include:

✅ Fetch and display users’ names and emails

✅ Reverse the order of users with a button

✅ A reusable <List /> component with generics

✅ A reusable <Greeting /> component with typed props

✅ Debugging examples with useEffect

How to run locally?
1) git clone https://github.com/MalakSabraa/UserDirectory.git
2) cd UserDirectory
3) npm install
4) npm run dev

Reflection:
1) How to debug infinite loops in useEffect and prevent them.
2) How to fetch data in React using useEffect and handle loading state.
3) How to build reusable components, like <Greeting /> and a generic <List />.
4) How to type API data with TypeScript interfaces.

Challenges:
Understanding why using fetch directly in useEffect can be a poor practice and how to use AbortController to clean up.
